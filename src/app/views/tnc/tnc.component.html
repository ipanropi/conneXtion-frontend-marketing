                            We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights

                            These Terms and any document expressly referred to in it constitutes the entire agreement between us regarding their 
                            subject matter, and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, 
                            representations, and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to that subject matter. You agree 
                            that you shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made 
                            innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms, or any document expressly referred to in it. You 
                            agree that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based 
                            on any statement in these Terms or any document expressly referred to in it.

                        <li>
                            If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights 
                            against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not 
                            mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in 
                            writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you. 
                        </li><br />
                        <li>
                            Each of the conditions of these Terms operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of 
                            them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect. 
                        </li><br />

                            governed by the law of Malaysia without regard to its conflict of law rules. In the event of any such disputes or 
                            claims in connection with these Terms, you agree to first engage in good faith discussions with us to resolve such 
                            dispute or claim. If such dispute or claim is not resolved within sixty (60) days, we both shall be referred to and 
                            finally resolved by arbitration in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Asian 
                            International Arbitration Centre (Malaysia) (“AIAC”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
